# First Project: Wiki Page

* Duration: 2 full days!
* Used: Django, Python(.py), HTML(.html), and minimal Markdown (.md)
* Satisfaction: 4.0/5.0
* Potential Improvements: Pin entries, tagging, formatting widgets (so no need to type in md format)
* Overall thoughts: I am really happy and proud of myself and what I've achieved in this short span of time :) It was honestly really fun and fulfilling, I'm glad to be on this journey and just see where it takes me x
